    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <div class="indented">Hello, my name is Yiming Xia, and I was born and currently live in Shanghai, China. Over the past few years, Shanghai has developed rapidly into a modern metropolitan city. You can feel its vibrancy through its well-developed transportation, diverse restaurants, and exciting entertainment options.</div>
    <div class="indented">I graduated from Tongji University about a decade ago with a degree in Software Engineering. After graduation, I began working for an organization primarily focused on financial regulation. In addition to handling my daily responsibilities, I have made significant contributions to my employer by providing technical support and solutions.</div>

    <h1>Development Background</h1>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Web Projects</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Poll System</strong>: This system, built with Django and deployed on an Amazon EC2 server, is designed to assist in evaluating employee performance at the end of each year.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Market Data Processing System</strong>: I built this system using Airflow and hosted it on an Amazon EC2 cluster to facilitate the monthly collection and processing of data from public websites.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Public Opinion System</strong>: This system integrates with third-party APIs to collect public opinion data, which is then presented in a web interface resembling an Excel spreadsheet. Like the first project, this one was also developed using Django and deployed on an Amazon EC2 server.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Software Projects</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            None of particular significance.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Deploying Pre-built Projects</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>PhotoPrism</strong>: A photo management system deployed via Docker on my home NAS, accessible from public network.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Emby</strong>: A home video management system, also deployed on my home NAS. I successfully enabled GPU-powered video transcoding, allowing users to seamlessly access large video files over the internet. The system converts these videos into optimized streams that adapt to the client's bandwidth limitations.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    <div class="indented">I have experience in building web projects from scratch, but these projects lack advanced UI functionality. I'd like to learn some advanced techniques to make my web pages more dynamic and visually appealing.</div>

                        <div class="indented">Shanghai Disneyland opened in 2016. Despite the presence of Tokyo Disneyland and Hong Kong Disneyland nearby, Shanghai Disneyland has attracted a large number of visitors from mainland China and has brought immense joy to them. </div>
                        <div class="indented">This photo was taken in 2017, just a year after its grand opening, when my wife and I dined at one of the park's restaurants and even had the chance to meet the beloved Donald Duck. In recent years, Shanghai Disneyland has continued to expand, adding two new themed areas: Toy Story Land and Zootopia. However, it remains consistently crowded, and ticket prices have steadily increased. </div>
                        <div class="indented">If someone were to ask me the best time to visit, I would definitely say the first day of the school term for elementary students, as parents are unlikely to bring their children to the park on that day.</div>
