        This restaurant, located by the Huangpu River in Shanghai, is called Guan Guan Ji. Its owner, a native of Xinjiang, has brought the region's signature delicacies—especially lamb—to Shanghai. The restaurant specializes in various styles of lamb dishes, which are known for their tenderness and lack of any gamey taste. My family, along with many locals, love dining here. In fact, this is precisely what makes Shanghai so attractive—it embraces diverse cultures from all over the world.

        The photo was taken in one coner of the lounge in the restaurant, with a slogan hanging on the wall. However, personally, I believe the translation is not entirely accurate, and the more appropriate one should be: "Both love and delicious food deserve to be cherished."
